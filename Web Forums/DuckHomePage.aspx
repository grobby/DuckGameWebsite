    Welcome to the Ducking Around, the Duckening&#39;s Home page.<br />
    <br />
    The story goes as told:<br />
    <br />
    
    Long ago in the duck land, there was peace and harmony between ducks and other birds; however, all that changed when the goose nation attacked.
     The evil goose general invaded Duckrania and crowned himself King of all Birds. For centuries, the ducks have lived in fear and horrible conditions;
     however, a new rebel group has risen up to destroy the Goose Dynasty. They hope to take back their land once and for all.
